Odin Project: Recipes Website

This is part of The Odin Project lesson on HTML.
A simple website will be created that will contain a main index page which links to separate recipe pages.
The recipe pages will consist of ingredients and detailed preparation instructions, as well as an example image of the completed dish.

Post-completion notes:
The main challenge of this lesson was not putting the webpages together, but actually practicing using git commands to update the repository (add, commit, push).

Also, proper formatting of href links between pages and knowing how to properly describe a file path and when one should be used over another (relative paths vs absolute links).

For example, the "Back to recipe list" link did not work properly 
as an absolute path when accessing via the published git website location. A relative path needed to be used.
